# Dunder Methods

_In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example **init** or **str**._

_Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:_

```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```

# Python Iterators

- _Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!_

- _To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the **iter** and **next** dunder methods._

- _Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions._

# Python Generators

- _Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators_

- _The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it._

- _Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement._
