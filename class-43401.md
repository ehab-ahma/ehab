**OSS Project**

_First timer contributions are normally very small and easy (One recent first-timers-only issue was literally three lines of simple changes! And the changes were described in great detail and tested by the project maintainer). But this makes it easier for the contributor to get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself. Remember, this isn’t as much about getting your project features implemented quickly as it is about helping first timers._

_Why is YAL (yet another label) like first-timers-only important? Because it makes a statement that first timers are welcome, that they are valued, and that they can start contributing to your project! Often the hard part of getting into open source for the first time isn’t the implementation of a feature, but figuring out how to actually contribute code such that the pull request is accepted! But, oh the feeling of accomplishment when your first PR is merged!_

**Contribute on Open Source**

- _A project you already use_

_Start by thinking about the projects you already use or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to._ 

- _An issue you can fix_

_Find a project that has a history and reputation for being welcoming to new contributors in GitHub's great for new contributors showcase._
