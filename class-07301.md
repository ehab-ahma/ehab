**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

**Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.**

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

**it is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.**
