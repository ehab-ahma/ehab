# NumPy

**_NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment. It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. An introduction to Matplotlib is also provided. All this is explained with the help of examples for better understanding._**

**Alternatively, NumPy package is imported using the following syntax âˆ’**

### Why Use NumPy?

**In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.**

### Import NumPy

```
import numpy
```

### Create a NumPy ndarray Object

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)

print(type(arr))
```

**Output**

```
[1 2 3 4 5]
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

### Dimensions in Arrays

**1-D Arrays**

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
```

**2-D Arrays**

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr)
```

**3-D arrays**

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(arr)
```

### Check Number of Dimensions?

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array(42)
b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(a.ndim)
print(b.ndim)
print(c.ndim)
print(d.ndim)
```

**Output**

```
0
1
2
3
```

### Access 2-D Arrays

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('5th element on 2nd row: ', arr[1, 4])
```

**Output**

```
5th element on 2nd dim:  10
```

### Slicing 2-D Arrays

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[1, 1:4])
```

**Output**

```
[7 8 9]
```

### Data Types in NumPy

**_Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them._**

```
i - integer
b - boolean
u - unsigned integer
f - float
c - complex float
m - timedelta
M - datetime
O - object
S - string
U - unicode string
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )
```

### Get the Shape of an Array

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

print(arr.shape)
```

**Output**

```
(2, 4)
```

**_where 2 is the number of arrays and 4 is number of elements in each array_**

### NumPy Array Reshaping

**_Reshape From 1-D to 2-D_**

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

newarr = arr.reshape(4, 3)

print(newarr)
```

**Output**

```
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
```

**Reshape From 1-D to 3-D**

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

newarr = arr.reshape(2, 3, 2)

print(newarr)
```

**Output**

```
[[[ 1  2]
  [ 3  4]
  [ 5  6]]

 [[ 7  8]
  [ 9 10]
  [11 12]]]
```
