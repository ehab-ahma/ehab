# Graphs


_A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges_

**Directed vs Undirected**

- _Undirected Graphs_

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction._

_For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional._

- _Directed Graphs (Digraph)_

_A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed._

_Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next._

_Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes._

```
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
