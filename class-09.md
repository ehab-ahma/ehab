- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

### Information about EVENT

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
