**_Using the Image Component_**

_Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images._

```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
```

_Adding Head to first-post.js
We haven't added a to our /posts/first-post route. Let's add one._

_Open the pages/posts/first-post.js file and add an import for Head from next/head at the beginning of the file:_

```
import Head from 'next/head'
```

**Then**

```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```

**Adding CSS**

_Now, let’s add some styles to the Layout component. To do so, we’ll use CSS Modules, which lets you import CSS files in a React component._

_Create a file called components/layout.module.css with the following content:_

```
.container {
  max-width: 36rem;
  padding: 0 1rem;
  margin: 3rem auto 6rem;
}
```

**Now**

```
import styles from './layout.module.css'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <div className={styles.container}>{children}</div>
}
```

# What is React context?

_React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props._

_In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily._

# What is the useContext hook?

_Looking at the example above, the render props pattern for consuming context may look a bit strange to you._

_Another way of consuming context became available in React 16.8 with the arrival of React hooks. We can now consume context with the useContext hook._

_Instead of using render props, we can pass the entire context object to React.useContext() to consume context at the top of our component._

_Here is the example above using the useContext hook:_

```
import React from 'react';

export const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
      <User />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

function User() {
  const value = React.useContext(UserContext);

  return <h1>{value}</h1>;
}
```

**Note**

_For many React beginners, Redux is a way of more easily passing around data. This is because Redux comes with React context itself._

_However, if you are not also updating state, but merely passing it down your component tree, you do not need a global state management library like Redux._
