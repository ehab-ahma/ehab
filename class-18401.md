# Encrypting a message

_The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount._

```
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
```

To make the encrypted message above, I shifted the alphabet by 6 and used this substitution table

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

```
YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK
```

# Decrypting a message

_According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message._

```
EHZDUH EUXWXV
```

_The comrade uses this substitution table, where the alphabet is shifted by and They can then decode the message with certainty. The first letter "E" was shifted by 3 from "B", the second letter "H" was shifted by 3 from "E", etc. The result is this ominous message:_

```
BEWARE BRUTUS
```
