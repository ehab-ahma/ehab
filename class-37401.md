# What Is React?

_React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”._

**Passing Data Through Props**

_To get our feet wet, let’s try passing some data from our Board component to our Square component._

_We strongly recommend typing code by hand as you’re working through the tutorial and not using copy/paste. This will help you develop muscle memory and a stronger understanding._

**Function Components**

_The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:_

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

_This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions._

**Create a Next.js App**

_Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications._

_Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands._
