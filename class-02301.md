# life cycle Method

**note : life cycle method only used within class component**

## Cases of cycle method

- ### Mounting : we use mounting methods when instance of component is being created and inserted into the dom

- ### updating : we use updating methods when a component is being re-renderd as a resuilt of changes to either its props or state

### we will describe the methids in **_the order of excution_**

- **constructore method: which is a metode that called when a new component is created to initialize a state**

- **render method: which read props and state and excute children component**
- **componentDidMount method: this method invoked immediatly when after the component and all its children component have been rendred**
- **react Updates method : these methods tregare when there is a change to eithere props or state**

**What types of things can you pass in the props?**

**Props (aka "properties") in React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc. Components cannot change their props - this can only be done externally, as the parent component changes the values passed down**

**What is the big difference between props and state?**

**‪What is the big difference between props and state? in react js** ‬‏
**Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters**

**When do we re-render our application?**

**React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically.**

**What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**

**Anything you can do in JavaScript, you can also do in React.**
