# Python Regular Expressions Tutorial

_We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers._

**Matching Characters**

_Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)_

_Using Regular Expressions_

_Now that we’ve looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The re module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them._

_Compiling Regular Expressions_

```
>>> import re
>>> p = re.compile('ab*')
>>> p
re.compile('ab*')
```

_The match Function_

_This function attempts to match RE pattern to string with optional flags.Here is the syntax for this function −_

```
re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

_The search Function_

```
re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

_Example_

```
import re

line = "Cats are smarter than dogs";

searchObj = re.search( r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', line, re.M|re.I)

if searchObj:
   print "searchObj.group() : ", searchObj.group()
   print "searchObj.group(1) : ", searchObj.group(1)
   print "searchObj.group(2) : ", searchObj.group(2)
else:
   print "Nothing found!!"
```

_Search and Replace_

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import re

phone = "2004-959-559 # This is Phone Number"

# Delete Python-style comments
num = re.sub(r'#.*$', "", phone)
print "Phone Num : ", num

# Remove anything other than digits
num = re.sub(r'\D', "", phone)
print "Phone Num : ", num
```
