# Today we are going to talk about list & Boxes in **HTML**

### list

**there are three kinds of lists**

- Numbered lists

are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.

- Bullet lists

 are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order).

-  Definition lists

are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms.

 ### Boxes
 **Box Dimensions,*width*,*height***

By default a box is sized just big 
enough to hold its contents. To 
set your own dimensions for a 
box you can use the height and 
width properties.
The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are 
to use pixels, percentages, or 
ems. Traditionally, pixels have 
been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to 
accurately control their size.

**we also can control dimensions of box through *Border, Margin 
& Padding* which is quite very helpful way specially that you can give the box border a colors 

# for javascript we are going to learn about *CREATING AN ARRAY*

**You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 
The values are assigned to the 
array inside a pair of square 
brackets, and each value is 
separated by a comma. The 
values in the array do not need 
to be the same data type, so you 
can store a string, a number and 
a Boolean all in the same array.**

### SWITCH STATEMENTS 
**A switch statement starts with a 
variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value**
.
