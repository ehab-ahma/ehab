# Domain modeling

**_Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem._**
<b>Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.</b>

<b><ol>

<li>When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.</li>
<li>Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.</li>
<li>Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.</li>
<li>Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.</li>
<li>Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.</li>
<li>Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside</li>
</ol></b>

# Tabel in html

<b><ol>

<li>The table tag element is used to add tables to a web page.</li>
<li>A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the tr tag element.</li>
<li> Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the td tag element (or th tag element if it is a header).</li>
<li> You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.</li>
<li> For long tables you can split the table into a thead tag element, tbody tag element, and tfoot tag element.</li>
</ol></b>

# Function methods and Object

<b>
<ol>
<li>Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. </li>
<li>Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.</li>
<li>An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.</li>
<li>In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.</li>
<li>Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.</li>
<li>JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. </li>
<li>Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other). </li>
</ol>
