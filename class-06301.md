# Node.js

- **Q1 Answer**

**Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.**

- **Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**

**it is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.**

- **Node is a JavaScript runtime**

**This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.**

- **npm**

**it stands for node package manger and it is the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download**

- **my node version is v14.17.0**

- **my npm version is 6.14.13**

- **‘jshint’ library command to install is \***npm install -g jshint**\***

- **node used for**

- **To have the ability to use These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.**

# Pair programming

- **Greater efficiency**

- **Engaged collaboration**

- **Learning from fellow students**

- **Social skills**

- **Job interview readiness**

- **Work environment readiness**

### in my opinion the most beneficial is Learning from fellow students

### This is how the Pair programmin work

**_pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code._**
