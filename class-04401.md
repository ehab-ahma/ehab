# Classes and Objects with python üêç

**_Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects._**

**You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class**

# Recursive Functions in Python

**_A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case._**

# Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

**_Do less work when testing your Python code, but be just as expressive, just as elegant, and just as readable. The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable‚Äîwith no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it‚Äôs just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries._**
