# A Beginner's Guide to Docker

_This is a beginner’s guide to Docker which is a way to isolate and run entire applications. With Docker it doesn’t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore. The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more._

**Linux Containers**

_Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up._


**let’s create our own image for something more “real.” on django**


```
$ cd ..
$ mkdir djangoapp && cd djangoapp
$ poetry install django==3.0
$ poetry shell```

```

```
(djangoapp) $ django-admin startproject example_project .
```
```
(djangoapp) $ python manage.py runserver
```
**Dockerized Django**

```
$ touch Dockerfile
$ touch docker-compose.yml
```


```
# Dockerfile

# Python version
FROM python:3.7-alpine

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /code

# Install dependencies
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock /code/
RUN pip install pipenv && pipenv install --system

# Copy project
COPY . /code/
```

```
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'

    volumes:

    ports:

```

```
$ docker-compose up --build
