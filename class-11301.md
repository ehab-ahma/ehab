**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

**NoSQL is best suited for data that has the following characteristics: 1. A high degree of self similarity but not exactly alike, or with a strong propensity**

**Give a real world example.**

**MongoDB**

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

**when you need a structred data and tables**

**Give a real world example.**

**BikeStores database**

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

**Choose NoSQL if you have or need: Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema**

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

**The clear winner with over 1/3 of multiple database type use is the combination of MySQL and MongoDB. While MongoDB is often considered an alternative to MySQL, the two databases do work well together when properly designed. The second most popular combination was MySQL and PostgreSQL together**

**What does SQL stand for?**

**SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems**

**What is a realational database?**

**A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another**

**What type of structure does a relational database work with**

**The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure**

**What is a ‘schema’?**

**A schema, or scheme, is an abstract concept proposed by J. Piaget to refer to our, well, abstract concepts. Schemas (or schemata) are units of understanding that can be hierarchically categorized as well as webbed into complex relationships with one another. For example, think of a house**

**What is a NoSQL database?**

**NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.**

**Howo does it work**

**NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). ... Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models**

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

**Learn How Automation Can Streamline Your Ops. Start Saving Time and Money Today. How Much Faster Could You Work if Your Database was Easy to Use, and Easy to Change? IP Whitelisting. Point-In-Time Recovery. Fully Automated & Elastic**

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why**

**SQL Databases Record While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions**

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

**Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability**
